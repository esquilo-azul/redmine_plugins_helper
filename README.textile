h3. Initializers

Just like other Rails applications or engines just put a initializer under the
directory */config/initializers*.

Note: plugins' initializers are runned after all plugins have registered.

h4. Example

File in *@/plugins/redmine_tasks_scheduler/config/initializers/assets.rb@*:

<pre>
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w(active_scaffold.css)
Rails.application.config.assets.precompile += %w(active_scaffold.js)
</pre>

h3. Post registration

Allows to run code like in *@Redmine::Plugin.register@* environment, but after
the plugin already is registered.

h4. Example

File in *@plugins/redmine_nonproject_modules/config/initializers/000_dependencies.rb@*:

<pre>
Redmine::Plugin.post_register :redmine_nonproject_modules do
  # Source: https://github.com/esquilo-azul/redmine_plugins_helper
  requires_redmine_plugin(:redmine_plugins_helper, version_or_higher: '0.3.0')
end
</pre>
